                 A map pack by Zachary Yaro                 


## To install the map pack
 1. Copy or move the "portal" folder (in the same location as this readme) to "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\portal".
   - On Windows 64-bit, replace “Program Files” with “Program Files (x86)”.  On older versions of Steam, replace “common” with your Steam username.
 2. Accept any folder merges (nothing should be overwritten unless you have downloaded an older version of PortalZ or you have the Portal: The Flash Version Mappack texture files, in which case the conflicting files should be identical).

## To play PortalZ: The First Slice
 1. Open Steam and launch Portal.
 2. Select “Bonus Maps”.
 3. Select “PortalZ: The First Slice”, and then click “Load”.
 * If you want to play a specific test chamber, you can open the developer console (which can be enebled in Options → Keyboard → Advanced) and run “map z_demo_chamber_#”, where “#” is the chamber number that you want to play.

## Some problems that may occur
 * Lighting is incomplete, missing, or may break in some chambers.
 * The door models in test chamber 10 sometimes disappear.  The doors are there, but will be completely white.
 * Chamber 05 may be a bit glitchy.  This is probably because Portal is not designed to do what I am trying to make it do the way I am trying to make it do it.
