************************************************************
* Thank you for downloading PortalZ: The First Slice beta! *
************************************************************
                   A map pack by Gamer_Z.


## To install the map pack
Copy or move the "portal" folder (in the same location as this readme) to "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\[yourSteamUserName]\portal" (replace "Program Files" with "Program Files (x86)" if you run Windows 64-bit edition).  Accept all folder merges (nothing should be overwritten unless you have downloaded an older version of PortalZ or you have the Portal: The Flash Version Mappack texture files, in which case it is safe to replace the existing files with the new ones).

## To play PortalZ: The First Slice
Open Steam and launch Portal.  When the main menu loads, select "Bonus Maps".  There should be an option on your Bonus Maps list labeled "PortalZ: The Firse Slice".  If you do not see it, you may need to scroll down.  Select "PortalZ: The First Slice" and then click the "Load" button.  If you want to play a specific test chamber, you can open the developers' console (which can be enebled in Options > Keyboard > Advanced) and type "map z_demo_chamber_#" where "#" is the chamber number that you want to play.  Be warned that glitches can occur after level loads if you do not start at the beginning.

## Some problems that may occur
 * Lighting may get messed up if sv_cheats is enabled and disabled repeatedly.  I am not going to worry about this because you should not be using sv_cheats! :P
 * Many glitches occur because of noclipping.  If you use noclip, you may accidentally trigger something too early or not trigger something at all, which can cause random glitches.  One example is that if you noclip past test chamber 01, you might get portals that lead into the void in test chamber 03.
 * The door models in test chamber 10 sometimes disappear.  The doors are there, but will be completely white.  I do not know why this happens, so if you do, please e-mail me at zmyaro@gmail.com!
 * Chamber 05 may be a bit glitchy.  This is probably because Portal is not designed to do what I am trying to make it do the way I am trying to make it do it.
 * Portal_Z. should not mess up any of you other Portal or Windows files.  If something bad happens outside of PortalZ (that cannot be fixed by quitting and re-launching Portal), it is not my fault!
