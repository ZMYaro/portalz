              A map pack by Zachary Yaro              


## To install the map pack
 1. Copy or move the “portal” folder (in the same location as this readme) to “C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\portal”.
   - On Windows 64-bit, replace “Program Files” with “Program Files (x86)”.  On older versions of Steam, replace “common” with your Steam username.
 2. Accept any folder merges (nothing should be overwritten unless you have downloaded an older version of PortalZ or you have the Portal: The Flash Version Mappack texture files, in which case the conflicting files should be identical).

## To play PortalZ: The 2020 Slice
 1. Open Steam and launch Portal.
 2. Select “Bonus Maps”.
 3. Select “PortalZ: The 2020 Slice”, and then click “Load”.
 * If you want to play a specific test chamber, you can open the developer console (which can be enebled in Options → Keyboard → Advanced) and run “map z_2020_chamber_#”, where “#” is the chamber number that you want to play.
