Hello, and welcome to the PortalZ human-narrated commentary track.  In commentary mode, you can hear me talk about things related to the development of PortalZ as you progress through the levels.  This is a project I have been working on (with quite a few breaks, obviously) since late 2009 or so.  It has gone through quite a few changes since then, influenced by other map packs, mods, Portal 2, and my improving skills as a level builder.

You are currently in my relaxation vault.  As you can see, this is a bit friendlier than the original.  This was intentional; I wanted my map pack to feature a more friendly GLaDOS than Portal, and I started that with a larger and better-furnished relaxation vault.

+-------------------------+
| ZC01, end of first room |
+-------------------------+
As with Portal's first room, this room forces to see yourself walk through the first portal.  In addition, the delay here forces you to wait and makes it more likely that you will see the emancipation grill that GLaDOS is talking about.  Finally, there is a spike pit.  I decided to use spike pits until goo pits are formally introduced because spikes are more widely recognized as dangerous.

| ZC01, second room |
+-------------------+
If this was to be a map pack that could stand on its own, it needed a tutorial section.  Rather than forcing experienced players to go through boring simple levels, I decided to build a playable version of the first Portal trailer.  This quickly introduces new players to Aperture signage as well as portalgun as a source of portals, and can introduce experienced players, who may get bored and wander around during the narration, to blue force field walls.  Speaking of those, I decided to go with the Combine force field wall texture because it will easily be recognized by players of Half-Life 2 or the Portal: The Flash Version map pack.

| ZC01, third room |
+------------------+
I actually had a little trouble with this room.  The cube did not want to stay still on the sloped platform, but it had to be sloped enough that the portalgun could hit it and the player could see the portal get created.  My solution was to hold the cube in place with an invisible wall until the portal was created.

Also, this chamber introduces the player to both the fact that objects can be portaled and that cubes can activate buttons.

+-------------------+
| ZC01, fourth room |
+-------------------+
This room was a lot of fun.  It very quickly showed players that emancipation grills fizzle portals, black walls are portal-proof, and white walls are portalable.  It also introduces the idea of an infinite loop fling.  That bit was actually very difficult to pull off, and there are a bunch of invisible walls set up to make sure the cube lands on the button.

| ZC01, bts area |
+----------------+
I want to be clear: this is not supposed to be a Half-Life crossover moment.  The primary reason I give the player the hazard suit is to enable health display, weapon switching, and sprinting.  Second to that, it established a point of continuity with the storyline of Portal: Rat Man, a mod I have been developing for a while.  In PRM, the player acquires the "Aperture Hazard Suit", which is what this is supposed to be.

| ZC02, entry |
+-------------+
This was originally the third test chamber.  I swapped it with the original test chamber two because I found it difficult to make fun portal test chambers without portals.

Another point, when you walk in, the portalgun fires an orange portal at the glass.  This both draws the player's attention to the portalgun without a long wait, like in Portal's chamber two, and also lets the player know that this portalgun fires orange portals, unlike the first portalgun in Portal.

+-------------------+
| ZC02, second area |
+-------------------+
While turrets are not formally introduced until later, I wanted to include them in this chamber--before you get the portalgun--because this is the last time a turret on a portalable floor poses a real threat.  On a related note, the fact that all these surfaces are portalable allows the player to go back through the chamber to get revenge on the turrets after acquiring the device.

+--------------------------+
| ZC02, third area, bridge |
+--------------------------+
This area initially had a bunch of turrets on either side.  During the development of this chamber, it was announced that Portal 2 would include, among other things, deadly lasers.  That seemed like a much more fun idea than just forcing the player to sprint down the hall and actually made this part of the chamber take time and thought.


+-----------------+
| ZC14, last room |
+-----------------+
Welcome to the first real test chamber I ever bulit.  The challenge was meant to be that you had to fling yourself from the same wall onto farther and father away portalable floors until you reached the end.  In the end, that proved to difficult--both to design with correct distances and to play without getting frustrated and quitting, and I changed to the final design.  When that ended up being too easy, I added the missile turrets to make people move faster.


+------------------+
| ZC20, near start |
+------------------+
"This area started out as 'Test Chamber 20' and was actually one of the first chambers I designed just to see how many turrets could be pointing at me before I could not cross the room.  I was originally intended to be the final chamber, but I decided I did not want the final 'official' chamber to involve turrets, so I came up with GLaDOS trying to kill you like in normal Portal.  I originally made the left path lead to an RPG and the right path lead to a room with a 'Tasty' cake package.  I changed this because I did not want the player to get any guns in this map pack, especially since people would probably use the RPG's third shot on GLaDOS, and I wanted GLaDOS to end up being your friend.  You can still access the RPG via noclip.  I added the Gravity Gun because I thought it would be fun for players to use turrets and chunks of wall to take out the turrets blocking the way to the exit.  As I said, this was one of the first chambers I designed, and it started my habit of allowing the player to see the exit and the obstacle preventing them from reaching it from the start.

| ZC20, in front of GLaDOS |
+--------------------------+
"For a long time, I had a black block inside the white rings above GLaDOS instead of the huge generator seen in normal Portal and Portal: Prelude.  I also had GLaDOS in a huge rectangular room.  One day I decided that it just was not good enough (this happened to be the day I beat Portal: Prelude), and decided I would attempt to replicate the original GLaDOS room.  Since it had to be much bigger than the original room to fit the generator, I added the slide into the office area from Prelude where you activate GLaDOS to both allow people who had played Prelude to know where they were and add some space between the chamber and the much larger new GLaDOS room so there were not parts of the generator sticking into chamber 20.
