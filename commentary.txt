Welcome to the first real test chamber I ever bulit.  The challenge was meant to be that you had to fling yourself from the same wall onto farther and father away portalable floors until you reached the end.  In the end, that proved to difficult--both to design with correct distances and to play without getting frustrated and quitting, and I changed to the final design.  When that ended up being too easy, I added the missile turrets to make people move faster.

"This area started out as 'Test Chamber 20' and was actually one of the first chambers I designed just to see how many turrets could be pointing at me before I could not cross the room.  I was originally intended to be the final chamber, but I decided I did not want the final 'official' chamber to involve turrets, so I came up with GLaDOS trying to kill you like in normal Portal.  I originally made the left path lead to an RPG and the right path lead to a room with a 'Tasty' cake package.  I changed this because I did not want the player to get any guns in this map pack, especially since people would probably use the RPG's third shot on GLaDOS, and I wanted GLaDOS to end up being your friend.  You can still access the RPG via noclip.  I added the Gravity Gun because I thought it would be fun for players to use turrets and chunks of wall to take out the turrets blocking the way to the exit.  As I said, this was one of the first chambers I designed, and it started my habit of allowing the player to see the exit and the obstacle preventing them from reaching it from the start.

"For a long time, I had a black block inside the white rings above GLaDOS instead of the huge generator seen in normal Portal and Portal: Prelude.  I also had GLaDOS in a huge rectangular room.  One day I decided that it just was not good enough (this happened to be the day I beat Portal: Prelude), and decided I would attempt to replicate the original GLaDOS room.  Since it had to be much bigger than the original room to fit the generator, I added the slide into the office area from Prelude where you activate GLaDOS to both allow people who had played Prelude to know where they were and add some space between the chamber and the much larger new GLaDOS room so there were not parts of the generator sticking into chamber 20.
