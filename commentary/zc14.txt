The electric fields are a mix of the ones from Portal: The Flash Version and Portal: Prelude.  I kept the general appearance from Flash Version because they just looked phenomenal, but I kept the yellow-orange color from Prelude since nothing else blue kills you, and it matched the color of the high energy pellets.  Also, like Prelude, electric fields fizzle cubes, which makes them essentially a combination red wall and fizzler rather than just a red wall on a timer.

As I have already said multiple times, I really like movable panels, and I really like reusing the same element for multiple parts of a chamber, but goodness, making it all work in physical space and choreographic all the moving parts can be a lot of work.
