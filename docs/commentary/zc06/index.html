	This looks like a simple introduction to flings, but is a little meaner in that if you try to put the portal at the top, you will most likely end up in the goo; instead, you have to place it lower and do a double fling.&nbsp; Initially, there was just a camera at a good portal location, which not everyone took as a hint, so I eventually added the X behind it, which got the message across.

<p>
	This one is a little weird in that, if you crouch during the fling, you can make it to the ledge without doing a double fling.&nbsp; That only really matters if you are trying to speed-run it though.

	Some players got a bit disoriented by the near-identical shafts, so some very clear indicators were added so they could more easily stay focused on how to proceed.

	While it has come a long way since then, this room was technically the first real test chamber I ever built.&nbsp; It was originally meant to challenge you to fling yourself from the same wall onto farther and father away portalable floors until you reached the end.&nbsp; In the end, that proved to difficult&mdash;both to design with correct distances and to play without getting frustrated and quitting, and I changed to the final design direction.&nbsp; I ultimately achieved something close to that goal when I built chamber seven, at least.&nbsp; The redesigned version of this room was kept big to make your flings feel more &ldquo;epic&rdquo;, as though you are launching yourself across long distances.&nbsp; Dodging missiles can also add to that &ldquo;epic&rdquo; feeling.&nbsp; I find missile turrets an interesting element to include because they are so slow that they do not really pose much of a challenge, but they add a bit of pressure anyway.
