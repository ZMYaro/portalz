<p>
	This first room makes it impossible to miss the point: there are gravity fields that turn on and off.&nbsp; There are other ways this could have been introduced, but I liked the idea of a big room full of things that rise to the ceiling at your command.&nbsp; The pillar is also big enough that, while you can still see the exit door indicators, attention is still squarely on the gravity field indicator.

<p>
	This room introduces uses of gravity fields that will become more important in chamber twelve&mdash;specifically, using them to perform wall-to-floor jumps and buttons that create their own fields to hold cubes to them.&nbsp; The chamber layout even makes the player walk past the latter a second time to get to the exit.

<p>
	The floor button could have activated the box dropper directly, but it was not obvious to all players that that was the case.&nbsp; Having it activate a pedestal button that the player had to press made that connection more apparent.
