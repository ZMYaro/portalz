<p class="rename-note">
	This was chamber 08 in <i>PortalZ: The First Slice</i> and chamber 12 (and chamber 17 in the code) in <i>PortalZ: The 2020 Slice</i>.

<p>
	I knew I wanted to do a companion cube level, and I really liked the idea of making the player guide the cube through the level without killing it.&nbsp; After <i>Portal 2</i> came out, I realized I had inadvertently been following primitive versions of some patterns that were more fleshed out in co-op levels.
</p>
<p>
	Also, fun fact, I worked on some of the earliest iterations of this level before I learned to make a cube dropper drop multiple cubes since it only ever needed to drop one companion cube.

<p>
	There was no reason the escape hatch had to be this dramatic; it was just too much fun to not do it once, and a part of a level that was all about cubes on top of cubes on top of cubes seemed the best place for it.

	One additional note: This was chamber 17 for the longest time, just to have it be the same number as <i>Portal</i>'s companion cube chamber, but it makes much more sense between chamber 09 and chamber 11 (which was previously chamber 10) so you play it while countering turrets with a cube is fresh in your mind, and manipulating the cube from a distance with portals is good preparation for the cube fling in chamber 11.
