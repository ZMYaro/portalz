<p class="rename-note">
	This was chamber 11 (and chamber 14 in the code) in <i>PortalZ: The 2020 Slice</i>.

	The electric fields are a mix of the ones from <i>Portal: The Flash Version</i> and <i>Portal: Prelude</i>.&nbsp; I kept the general appearance from <i>Flash Version</i> because they just looked phenomenal, but I kept the yellow-orange color from <i>Prelude</i> since nothing else blue kills you, and it matched the color of the high energy pellets.&nbsp; Also, like <i>Prelude</i>, electric fields fizzle cubes, which makes them essentially a combination red wall and fizzler, rather than just a red wall on a timer.

	As I have already said multiple times, I really like movable panels, and I really like reusing the same element for multiple parts of a chamber, but goodness, making it all work in physical space and choreographing all the moving parts can be a lot of work.
