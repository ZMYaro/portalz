<p class="rename-note">
	This was chamber 10 (and chamber 12 in the code) in <i>PortalZ: The 2020 Slice</i>.

	As I have said before, I really liked the concept of <i>Portal</i> test chambers being made out of movable panels, and I really disliked waiting for lifts.&nbsp; Having the floor turn into staircases addressed both of those.

	Originally, this chamber had a much different layout, with a sideways button granting you access to a sideways fling over goo on the other side of the chamber.&nbsp; That had the issue of making you replay the entire chamber from the start if you accidentally dropped the cube into the goo during that final fling.&nbsp; This redesigned version makes raising the sideways button sort of a checkpoint, and also lets you reuse an element for multiple parts of the test.&nbsp; I am incredibly happy with it.
